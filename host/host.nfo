# For all of the HOST sources.

- bridge.py is the main server script
- interfaces.py defines the base interface class and various derived classes.
The server uses these interface types to communicate with network entities such as
cars and clients.
- streamhandler.py contains the StreamDisplayer thread, factored out from CarInterface.
